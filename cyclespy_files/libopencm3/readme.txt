Copy the libopenCM3 project files into this directory, for example using:

git clone https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3.git

Make sure to have at least MAKE and the ARM-gcc compiler installed. The Readme of the libopencm3 project
describes in detail how to install these tools and how to add them to your PATH (if it isn't already added).

After cloning and having the prerequisites installed, run 'MAKE' on this directory.

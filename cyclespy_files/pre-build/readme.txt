If you have an already build .elf files you want to use for your recording sessions, you can place them in this directory
and find them using 'board_helper.find_elf_files_by_name()'. Make sure to place it in the directory with the name of
the device you want to test, so for example for the stm32f103rb the elf file should be placed in './pre-build/stm32f103rb/'.

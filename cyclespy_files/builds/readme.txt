The 'builds' folder will contain (temporary) files that are used to build the .elf file and will also contain the compiled .elf files itself.
This folder can safely be emptied as every file can be rebuild easily with the files in the 'asm' directory.

Note that for cleaning the builds folder there is the function called 'cyclespy_helper.clean_builds_folder()' .
